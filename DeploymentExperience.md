#Frist of all, this sprint was nicely documented, and was fairly easy to follow along. It has helped me to depthen my knowlege in deployment.

# What really went well for me was, following each steps, and kind understand what it is doing. Especially with the white-noise library, it was tricky to config it. One thing I have master in web programming is that there is always something new. The question is, how do I connect the dots, with what I already know. That been said, I still don’t understand the ins and outs of the library, but from the docs, I can see the library serves static files for python web apps, in-order for that to work, we have to config in our setting, in other word, tell the library where we want our static files to be(the path to the files).

#Another thing I learned about deployment is, each server platform has its own way, that we have to follow those requirment as developers. we may not need much of config to work on development stages, but the production stage seems to need little more config. Example would be, when in deployment, heroku looks for requirment.txt and Procfile, two files, that must have in heroku git repo, but don’t need in development stage in local repo.

#In conclusion, this was much easier to follow, with each steps written clearly. And I feel I have gained more, cant wait for project week.....
